--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overview**

This Streamlit-based application enables users to:

Extract text, images, and tables from PDFs.

Interact with an AI-powered chatbot for in-depth PDF content analysis.

Perform AI-driven image analysis on extracted images using advanced LLMs.

**Large Language Models (LLMs) Utilized**

1. DeepSeek-R1 (70B Llama Variant)

Utilized for text-based PDF question-answering in text_llm.py.

2. LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)

Used for image analysis in image_llm.py.

Accepts and processes both text and image inputs.

**Libraries and Tools**

Streamlit: Web UI framework for interactive applications.

unstructured.partition.pdf: Extracts structured data (text, tables, images) from PDFs.

OpenAI: Enables AI-driven chatbot functionalities.

Requests: Facilitates API calls to external LLMs (via Ollama for image analysis).

glob, os, shutil: Manages file handling operations.

base64: Encodes images for API-based communication.

PIL (Pillow): Image processing.

fpdf: Generates PDFs from modified text.
